set nowrap

" basic syntax highlighting and auto-indenting

filetype indent on
filetype plugin indent on
set tabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4

" makes scrolling easier
set scrolloff=5

"Plugins (only Nerdtree here)
" i use vim-plug here

call plug#begin()
  Plug 'preservim/nerdtree'
call plug#end()

let NERDTreeShowHidden=1
```
