Now, two of my favourite plugins whether or not you use lua are 
the fuzzy finder and the tagbar.

Fuzzy finder (fzf) written in Go allows you to find files quickly 
in your current directory. 

Tagbar allows you to navigate if your source file is very long. You 
are able to see a sidepane which helps you navigate between sections 
of code. Very sueful for LaTeX where there are long files.

## init.vim
Here is a basic setup for vim-rainbow along with the previous plugins.
```vim
set relativenumber
set number

" nowrap helps you see if you need to move to the next line
set nowrap

" basic syntax highlighting and auto-indenting
syntax on
filetype indent on
filetype plugin indent on
set tabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4

" makes scrolling easier
set scrolloff=5

## Telescope and Harpoon (lua)

No lua based nvim setup is quite complete without telescope and harpoon
the input files (for Arch Linux) for a very simple harpoon and telescope 
setup are placed here. just copy and paste. 

Telescope is like fzf, but more fully featured out of the box. 
Harpoon basically allows you to save bookmarks of important files and 
navigate between them.



## other stuff..

If you want to paste in neovide or neovim:

When in command mode:
```
"+p
```
